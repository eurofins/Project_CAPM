Plan Stakeholder Management
*******

1. Plan Stakeholder Management is the process of developing appropriate management strategies to effectively engage
   stakeholders throughout the project life cycle, based on the analysis of their needs, interests, and potential 
   impact on project success.

2. The key benefit of this process is that it provides a clear, actionable plan to interact with project stakeholders
   to support the projectâ€™s interests.

3. Plan Stakeholder Management identifies how the project will affect stakeholders, which then allows the project manager
   to develop various ways to effectively engage stakeholders in the project, to manage their expectations, and to ultimately
   achieving the project objectives.

4. Stakeholder management is more than improving communications and requires more than managing a team.

5. Stakeholder management is about creation and maintenance of relationships between the project team and stakeholders,
   with the aim to satisfy their respective needs and requirements within project boundaries.

6. As the project progresses, the membership of the stakeholder community and required level of engagement may change, therefore,
   stakeholder management planning is an iterative process that is reviewed on a regular basis by the project manager.
