Process: Develop project CharterIn this Process, a document is developed which formally authorizes the existence of a project (Project Charter).The document authorizes the Project Manager to apply organizational resources to project activities.The document provides a well defined project start and project boundaries.
Project Charter is used to establish internal agreements within the organization to assure proper delivery under the contract.
A Formal contract other than the Project Charter is the preferred way used to establish an agreement in case of external projects, where the project team becomes the seller for an offer made by the an outside entity.
The project Charter needs to be approved.
The approved Project Charter formally initiates the projectThe Project Manager is identified and assigned as is feasible, while the project charter is being developed and always prior to the start of planning.The project charter provides the project manager the authority to plan and execute the project.
The Project Charter should be authored by the sponsoring entity.
It is recommomended that the project Manager participate in the development of the project charter to obtain a foundational understanding of the project requirements. This understanding will better allow for efficient resources allocation to project activities.
Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as sponsor, Program or project management office staff person, or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative.
The Project Initiator or sponsor should be at the level to procure funding and commit resources to the project.projects are initiated due to the internal business needs or external influences.
