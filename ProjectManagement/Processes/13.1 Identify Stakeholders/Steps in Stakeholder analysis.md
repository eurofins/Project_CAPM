Steps in Stakeholder Analysis
****************

1. Identify all potential project stakeholders and relevant information, such as their roles, departments,
interests, knowledge, expectations, and influence levels.

  - Key stakeholders are usually easy to identify.They include anyone in a decision-making or management role who is 
    impacted by the project outcome, such as the sponsor, the project manager, and the primary customer.
    
  - Identifying other stakeholders is usually done by interviewing identified stakeholders and expanding the list until 
    all potential stakeholders are included.
    
    
2. Analyze the potential impact or support each stakeholder could generate, and classify them so as to define 
   an approach strategy. In large stakeholder communities, it is important to prioritize the stakeholders to 
   ensure the efficient use of effort to communicate and manage their expectations.
   
   
3. Assess how key stakeholders are likely to react or respond in various situations, in order to plan how to 
   influence them to enhance their support and mitigate potential negative impacts.

   Classification Models used for Stakeholder Analysis
   ************
   
   - Power/interest grid, grouping the stakeholders based on their level of authority (“power”) and their level
     or concern (“interest”) regarding the project outcomes;

   - Power/influence grid, grouping the stakeholders based on their level of authority (“power”) and their
     active involvement (“influence”) in the project;

   - Influence/impact grid, grouping the stakeholders based on their active involvement (“influence”) in the 
     project and their ability to effect changes to the project’s planning or execution (“impact”); and

   - Salience model, describing classes of stakeholders based on their power (ability to impose their will), 
     urgency (need for immediate attention), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).
